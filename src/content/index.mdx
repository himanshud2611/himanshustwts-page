nice to meet you!! i'm himanshu, just passed out my engineering course in IT. this is my little corner of the internet :)

<br/>

<p class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold">a little bit about me:</p>

- learning, building and iterating at the intersection of ai and real world challenges. we’re building your cursor for apps. (visit [bhindi.io](https://bhindi.io))
- [14-10-2024] i’ve worked as a Machine Learning Intern at a US-based startup (remotely). the org is building an end-to-end autonomous AI agent platform for hiring automation, data enrichment, and document processing. i’ve contributed on building backend pipelines, browsing agents, and applicatioon layer using LMs.
- [01-06-2024] previously I worked as a Research Intern at [Trust Lab, IIT Bombay](https://trustlab.iitb.ac.in/) where i’d collaborated on a project entitled **'Domain Knowledge based Q/A for LLMs'**, optimizing and fine-tuning LLMs for open-ended medical question answering.  I’ve been building an execution pipeline incorporating DSPy (python framework by stanfordnlp) in this project.
- [15-8-2024] additionally, i’ve collaborated with **Cupric** as a **Software Engineer (AI/ML)** where i’ve been building a follow-up care tool for the medical domain. my work revolves around building ML backend pipelines. (visit [cupric.tech](https://cupric.tech))

<p class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold">some fun facts about me:</p>

- i love those ***architectures***! i’m usually fascinated by how things work under the hood, the underlying maths, how to make intuitions
- i passionately write and publish blogs around ml, dl, cv, and nlp. my focus always has been to write as intutive as possible keeping the flow interesting. it can be the case many times i will bore explaining the mathematics behind those approaches and architectures. (believe me, those are lovely!) 
- exploring, ideating, and building AI agents.
- lowkey geopolitics excites me.

<br/>

<p class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold">what am i working on?</p>

- implementing papers, and architectures and diving more into foundations.
- focussing more on the backend and LLMOps
- some cool ML projects 
- building [groundzero.ai](https://groundzero.netlify.app)
